Description: HTTP::Negotiate - choose a variant to serve
 This module provides a complete implementation of the HTTP content
 negotiation algorithm specified in draft-ietf-http-v11-spec-00.ps
 chapter 12. Content negotiation allows for the selection of a preferred
 content representation based upon attributes of the negotiable variants
 and the value of the various Accept* header fields in the request.
