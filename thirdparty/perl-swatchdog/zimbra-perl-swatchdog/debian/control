Description: swatchdog - Simple Log Watcher
 swatchdog.pl started out as swatch, the "simple watchdog" for activity
 monitoring log files produced by UNIX's syslog facility. It has since
 been evolving into a utility that can monitor just about any type of
 log. The name has been changed to satisfy a request made by the old
 Swiss watch company.
