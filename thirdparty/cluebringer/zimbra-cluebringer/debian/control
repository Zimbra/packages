Description: ClueBringer Policy Daemon
 PolicyD v2 (codenamed "cluebringer") is a multi-platform policy server for popular
 MTAs. This policy daemon is designed mostly for large scale mail hosting environments.
 The main goal is to implement as many spam combating and email compliance features as
 possible while at the same time maintaining the portability, stability and performance
 required for mission critical email hosting of today. Most of the ideas and methods
 implemented in PolicyD v2 stem from PolicyD v1 as well as the authors' long time
 involvement in large scale mail hosting industry.
