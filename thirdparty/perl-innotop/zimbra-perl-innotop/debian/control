Description: innotop - mariadb monitor
 innotop monitors MySQL/MariaDB servers.  Each of its modes shows you a different
 aspect of what's happening in the server.  For example, there's a mode for monitoring
 replication, one for queries, and one for transactions.  innotop refreshes its
 data periodically, so you see an updating view.
