Description: prepflog.pl - Pre-processor for pflogsumm
 The script sanitizes mail log files that are to be passed to pflogsumm or awstats
 disregarding the lines relating to the re-injection of messages into postfix. I
 use it with amavisd-new configured as a postfix after queue content filter which
 does anti spam checks through spamassassin and antivirus checks through a third
 party virus checker. If your postfix setup requires additional content filters
 resulting in 3 or more passages of the same message through postfix, this script
 will not work for you.
